Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that\nare geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and\nreturned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.\nOne approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,\nand annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers\nwho purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the\npricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will\nbe key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a\nvery good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic\nprogram and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to\ndo that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why\ncasual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are\ninterested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\n\nFor the analysis I will follow 6 steps of Data Analysis which are **Ask,Prepare,Process,Analyze,Share** and **Act**.\n\n## Phase1: Ask\n\n### Business Task\n\nCyclistic, a bike share company wants to understand how their annual members(who purchase annual memberships) and casual riders(who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) use bike-share offering differently.Based on the insights of the analysis company may launch some marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n* Lily Moreno,The director of marketing and my manager\n* Other members of Cyclistic marketing analytics team\n* Cyclistic executive team\n\n## Phase2: Prepare\n\nData is good first party public data and is located at <https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>.The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this <https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement>.\nData is reliable,original,comprehensive,current and cited. Data is organized by months,some are by quarters,some are by years.\n\nfor the analysis I will take consideration of data of **June2021-July2022** period.I will download the data and store it
